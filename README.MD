# SingleFile
SingleFile is a Web Extension compatible with Chrome, Firefox (Desktop and Mobile), Opera, and Edge that helps you to save a complete web page into a single HTML file.

## Demo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdV8DBW5b0g

## Install
 - Firefox Add-ons: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/single-file
 - Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle
 - Edge, Opera: The extension is not on the store yet, you must download the zip file (https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/archive/master.zip) and install it manually

## Instructions
- wait until the page is fully loaded: you may need to scroll down the entire page to be sure all elements are loaded
- click on the SingleFile button in the extension toolbar to save the page

## General notes
- right-click on the SingleFile button and select "Options"/"Manage extension" to open the options page
- to save multiple tabs, select them first and click on the SingleFile button
- use the context menu to save a tab, all tabs, selected tabs, selected content, or frame content
- saved files are compatible with all modern browsers *without installing any extension*
- SingleFile uses "data URI" scheme to embed resources into the page: the resulting format is *not compatible* with MHT/MHTML.

## More info
See the extension help in options page for more detailed information about options, technical notes and known issues.

## Issues
If you find an unknown issue:
- reset options in SingleFile options page
- disable all other extensions to see if there is a conflict
- if there is a conflict, try to determine against which extension(s)
- report the issue with a short description describing how to reproduce it, browser version, OS name and version here: https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/issues
